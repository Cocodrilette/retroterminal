# The RetroTerminal CRM Manifesto

## Our Philosophy: Back to Basics

In a world of bloated software and complex interfaces, we believe in a return to simplicity. The RetroTerminal CRM is a love letter to the command-line interfaces of the past, a testament to the power of a focused, text-based workflow.

We prioritize:

- **Speed:** No unnecessary animations, no sluggish frameworks. Just pure, unadulterated performance.
- **Focus:** A clutter-free interface that lets you concentrate on what matters: your customers.
- **Keyboard-First:** Every action is a command away. Become a power user and watch your productivity soar.

## Core Features

- **Contact Management:** Keep track of your customers with a simple, searchable database.
- **Interaction Logging:** Log calls, emails, and meetings with ease.
- **Task Scheduling:** Never miss a follow-up with our integrated task manager.
- **Sales Pipeline:** Visualize your sales process from lead to conversion.

This is more than just a CRM. It's a statement. It's a commitment to a better way of working.

**Welcome to the RetroTerminal.**
